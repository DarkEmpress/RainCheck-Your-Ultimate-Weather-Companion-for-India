1. LOGISTIC REGRESSION
ACCURACY OPTIMISATION
STEP 1: CHANGING THE MAX ITERATIONS TO SEE WHAT SEEMS FIT
    INITIAL: WE CONSIDERED temperature_farenheit, wind_kph, wind_degree, pressure_mb, humidity, cloud
    ITERATION           ACCURACY(%)
    1000                Reached Limit
    2000                Reached Limit
    3000                Reached Limit
    4000                Reached Limit
    5000                Reached Limit
    6000                Reached Limit
    7000                Reached Limit
    8000                Reached Limit
    9000                68.4780
    10000               68.4780
    11000               68.4780
    Conclusion: Accuracy does not increase as the max iterations increase
STEP 2:CHANGING THE Xs THAT DETERMINE THE Y
    I. INITIAL: WE CONSIDERED temperature_farenheit, wind_kph, wind_degree, pressure_mb, humidity, cloud
        Accuracy:68.4780
    II.Now we consider temperature_farenheit, wind_kph, pressure_mb, humidity, cloud
       Accuracy:68.4256
    III. INITIAL: WE CONSIDERED temperature_farenheit, wind_kph, wind_degree, pressure_mb, humidity, cloud, visibility_km
        Maximum iterations reach imit at max_iter=9000
        max_iter=50000
        accuracy:84.
        NOTE: The maximum iterations reached limit!!
    CONCLUSION: since we we tried ways to improve accuracy by modifying dependent variables and increasing max_iter yet did not get satisfactory results now we are going for another model that fits best for this dataset

2. DECISION TREE CLASSIFICATION
    Xs: location_name, temperature_farenheit, wind_kph, wind degree, pressure_mb, humidity, cloud, visibility_km
    Y: condition_text
    test_size=0.2
    random_state=56
    tree classifier random state= 37
    accuracy=91.92766347791903 %
